New sample programs
===========================================================================

                    Borland C++ & Application Frameworks 3.1 includes many
                    new sample programs to show you how to take advantage
                    of features new to Windows 3.1, such as multimedia,
                    TrueType, DDEML (Dynamic Data Exchange Management
                    Library), drag and drop, common dialog boxes, and OLE
                    (Object Linking and Embedding). Many of these samples
                    are available as both C and C++ programs. In the IDE,
                    choose Project|Open and choose the directory and
                    project file for the sample you want to see. For the
                    command-line compiler, go to the directory and run MAKE
                    to build the project.


    EXAMPLES\WIN31  =======================================================

                    These samples are in C and use traditional methods of
                    Windows programming.
